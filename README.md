🧠 Overview
Marketing Sentiment Pro began as a simple Python script for analyzing Twitter sentiment. It has been architecturally enhanced into a modular, containerized web application to serve as a demonstration of DevOps principles applied to marketing technology.
This tool allows marketing teams to gain instant insights into public perception of brands, products, or campaigns by analyzing real-time Twitter data, presented through an intuitive dashboard.
Core Value Proposition: To provide a cost-effective, customizable, and deployable alternative to expensive SaaS social listening tools, specifically designed for teams that value data ownership and integration into their existing DevOps workflows.

🏗️ Architecture & Development Journey
This project exemplifies a modern development lifecycle:
1.	Prototyping (v0.1): Started as a monolithic Jupyter notebook/script for rapid proof-of-concept validation using Tweepy and TextBlob.
2.	Modularization & Refactoring (v1.0): The monolith was decomposed into a clean, maintainable structure with separation of concerns (UI, logic, API, utilities). This improved testability and collaboration potential.
3.	Containerization (v1.1): The application was Dockerized, encapsulating its environment and dependencies. This ensures consistent behavior across all deployment targets (local, cloud, hybrid) and simplifies CI/CD pipeline integration.
4.	Deployment Ready (v1.2): Configured for seamless deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud and other container-ready platforms, demonstrating the end-to journey from code to cloud.

🚀 Installation & Deployment
Option 1: Local Development
1.	Clone the repo: git clone <your-repo-url>
2.	Navigate to directory: cd marketing-sentiment-pro
3.	Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
4.	Activate it:
o	Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
o	Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
5.	Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
6.	Set up secrets: Create .streamlit/secrets.toml and add your Twitter API keys:
toml
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY = "your_key_here"
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET = "your_secret_here"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_token_here"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = "your_token_secret_here"
7.	Run the app: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Option 2: Docker (DevOps Demo)
1.	Build the image:
bash
docker build -t sentiment-app .
2.	Run the container:
bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 sentiment-app
3.	Access the app: Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.
Option 3: Deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud
1.	Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.	Go to share.streamlit.io, sign in, and click "New app".
3.	Select your repository, branch, and main file path (streamlit_app.py).
4.	Crucially: In the advanced settings, paste your Twitter API secrets into the provided fields.
5.	Click "Deploy". Your application will be live on a public URL within minutes.

🔮 Enhancement Potential & Roadmap
This MVP is a foundation. Here’s the strategic roadmap for transforming it into a full-featured product:
🟢 Phase 1: Immediate Value-Adds (Low Hanging Fruit)
•	Historical Trend Analysis: Plot sentiment scores over time using a time-series database.
•	Competitor Comparison Dashboard: Side-by-side analysis of multiple brands/keywords.
•	Multi-Platform Support: Integrate Reddit and News API for a broader view.
•	Advanced NLP: Integrate SpaCy or Hugging Face models for more accurate sentiment and entity recognition.
🟡 Phase 2: DevOps & Scalability
•	CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing and deployment on push to main branch using GitHub Actions.
•	Database Backend: Integrate PostgreSQL or Snowflake for storing historical data and enabling complex queries.
•	Scheduled Data Pipelines: Use Apache Airflow/Prefect to run analyses daily/hourly.
•	API-First Architecture: Rebuild the backend as a FastAPI service, separating it from the Streamlit frontend.
🔴 Phase 3: Enterprise Features
•	User Authentication & RBAC: Login system with role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Marketer, Viewer).
•	Alerting System: Slack/Email notifications for sentiment spikes or negative trend detection.
•	Advanced Reporting: Automated PDF report generation and delivery.
•	Data Warehouse Integration: Push analyzed data to BigQuery/Snowflake for integration with other BI tools.
